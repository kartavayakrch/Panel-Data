# Wage Data Analysis

Wage Data Analysis project. Exploration how different factors like education, work experience, and union membership affect hourly wages.

## What We'll Do
1. **Set Up the Data**: Turn our dataset into a panel data frame.
2. **Build Models**: Create pooled, random effects, and fixed effects models to see which one fits best.
3. **Compare & Choose**: Use statistical tests to pick the best model and refine it by dropping insignificant variables.
4. **Interpret Results**: Make sense of the important factors influencing wages.
5. **Extra Analysis**: Look at 1980 data to find out how education and experience affect the chances of having a high wage.
